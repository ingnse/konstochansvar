# Images Directory

This directory contains all images for the website, organized by type.

## Directory Structure

- **content/**: Images used within page content
- **gallery/**: Portfolio and project gallery images
- **team/**: Team member profile photos

## Adding Images

1. Place images in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
3. Optimize images before uploading (compress, resize)
4. Reference in content using: `/assets/images/[subdir]/filename.ext`

See `IMAGE_GUIDE.md` in the project root for detailed instructions.
